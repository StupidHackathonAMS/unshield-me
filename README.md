## What is this stuff?

Is a chrome extension, backend app and frontend app. That tracks all your activity in the browser and makes it public. It contains the next set of features:
* Log data from pages you visited.
* Log time spent in pages.
* Automatig tagging of pages visited.
* Log all information from the froms filled.
* Recognition of credit card numbers from forms filled.
* Ask intrusive questions.

## Why would I want to use this?

Definetly you should not use it, it would be a really bad idea. But if you use it the responsability is on you.

## So... why did you do this?

We created this at the [Stupid Hackathon 2018](https://stupidhackathon.wtf) in Amsterdam, in which attendees are challenged to build something amazing, stupid, and useless.
